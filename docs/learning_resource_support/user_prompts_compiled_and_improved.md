**Original:**
> Creat a deployemnt documentation and diagram in docs file .md

**Improved:**
> Create deployment documentation and an architecture diagram in a Markdown file in the docs folder.

**Improved:**
> For each technology or tool used in this project (Streamlit, Dash, FastAPI, Flask, data analysis, Docker, Nginx, etc.), create a separate, structured Markdown file in the learning_resource_support folder. Each file should include a glossary, syntax examples, use cases, setup instructions, best practices, and external learning links, so that new team members can easily learn each technology.

**Suggestion:**
- Break long prompts into clear, numbered requirements for easier understanding.
- Use bullet points for lists of required sections.
