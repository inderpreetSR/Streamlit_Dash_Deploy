# Project Structure & Development Workflow Learning Resource

## Overview
A well-organized project structure improves maintainability, collaboration, and scalability. This project follows a modular, service-oriented structure.

## Key Concepts & Glossary
- **Modularization**: Splitting code into logical components
- **Service-Oriented**: Each major function is a separate service
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized settings
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API docs

## Syntax & Examples
```

  └── ...
```

## Common Use Cases
- Large, multi-service projects
- Collaborative development
- Production-ready deployments

## Setup & Usage
- Follow the directory structure for adding new features
- Use `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- Add docs in `docs/`

## Best Practices
- Keep code modular and well-documented
- Use version control (git)
- Write tests for utilities and APIs

## How the Structure is Used in This Project
- Modular source code in `src/`
- Data, docs, and tests in dedicated folders
- Docker and deployment scripts at the root 

## Core Concepts Used in This Project
- Modular, service-oriented structure for maintainability and scalability.
- Chosen for clarity, separation of concerns, and ease of collaboration.
- Used dedicated folders for data, source, docs, and tests.

## Ignored/Alternative Concepts
- Not used: Monolithic scripts, flat file structures, or single-file apps.
- Reason: Modular structure is best for multi-service, production projects.

## Other Concepts You Could Use
- Monorepo with submodules for very large teams
- Cookiecutter templates for rapid setup
- Automated code linting and CI/CD integration

## Technology Foundations
- Based on best practices from Python, data science, and web development communities.

## Advantages & Disadvantages
**Advantages:**
- Easy to navigate and extend
- Supports team development
- Scales to production

**Disadvantages:**
- More setup than a single script
- Can be overkill for tiny projects
